📌 Rabin-Karp String Matching Algorithm
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Rabin-Karp algorithm for efficient pattern matching using hashing. It is useful for finding all occurrences of a pattern within a given text.

🧠 Algorithm Overview
The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses a rolling hash function to compare substrings in the text with the target pattern. It is efficient for multiple pattern searches and handles collisions with a secondary check.

🛠️ Features
Rolling hash-based substring search
Efficient for large texts
Simple Python implementation
